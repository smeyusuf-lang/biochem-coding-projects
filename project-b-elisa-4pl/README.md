# Project B: ELISA 4PL Analysis in R

This project recreates a classic **ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)** analysis workflow in R.  
Instead of Excel-based curve fitting, I built a reproducible pipeline that simulates ELISA data, fits a **4-parameter logistic (4PL) model**, and predicts unknown sample concentrations.

---

## 🔬 What I did
- Simulated ELISA standard curve data with replicates and added experimental noise.  
- Aggregated replicates (mean ± SD).  
- Fit a 4-parameter logistic curve using the `drc` package.  
- Plotted the standard curve with error bars on a log10 axis.  
- Predicted concentrations of unknown samples by inverting the model.  
- Exported results as CSV and PNG for reporting.

## 📊 Example output

Here is the fitted **4PL ELISA standard curve** with error bars and fitted line:

## 💡 Why this matters
ELISA is one of the most widely used assays in biomedical science.  
Automating the analysis in R makes the workflow **transparent, reproducible, and industry-ready** — valuable skills for both research and pharma.

## 🚀 Next steps
- Extend the workflow to a **5-parameter logistic (5PL)** model.  
- Import and analyse **real ELISA plate data**.  
- Build a **Shiny app** for interactive curve fitting and QC.
