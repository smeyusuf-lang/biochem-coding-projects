# Project C — Cheminformatics

This folder holds my mini cheminformatics project built in Google Colab.  
I wanted to get some hands-on experience with RDKit and scikit-learn by trying out a simple, real-data workflow.

## What’s inside
- **Notebook:** My Colab notebook where I load the ESOL/Delaney solubility dataset, calculate a few basic molecular descriptors, plot them and build a very simple linear model.
- **Data & Outputs:** CSV with computed descriptors and the saved plots from the notebook.

## Why I did it
I’m interested in computational chemistry and wanted a small project that mirrors what might happen in a placement: taking chemical structures, turning them into numbers, exploring trends and doing a quick prediction model.

## Next steps
- Try different descriptors (e.g. fingerprints)
- Compare linear regression to a non-linear model
- Use cross-validation to check performance
