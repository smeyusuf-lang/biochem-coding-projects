# My STEM Projects & Coding Portfolio

Hi! I’m Sarah Yusuf — an MSci Biochemistry student at the University of Birmingham.  
This repo is where I keep the projects I’ve been working on to build my technical and analytical skills alongside my degree.

## What’s here
- **Project C — Cheminformatics:** My first hands-on computational chemistry project.  
  Inside you’ll find a Google Colab notebook using RDKit and scikit-learn on a real solubility dataset (ESOL).  
  I calculate basic molecular descriptors, do quick plots and run a simple linear model to predict solubility.  
  [Open the project folder here](project-c-cheminformatics).

- (Future projects will go here too — I’m planning to add more Python and R mini-projects over time.)

## Why I’m doing this
I’m keen to show how I combine my biochemistry background with coding and data analysis.  
This repo acts as a public portfolio of the skills I’m building for placement year applications and beyond.

## Next steps
- Add more computational chemistry and data science mini-projects
- Tidy and document older notebooks
- Explore small R projects to complement the Python work
