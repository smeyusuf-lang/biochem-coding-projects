# Biochemistry & Informatics Projects — Sarah Yusuf  

Hi! I’m **Sarah Yusuf**, an MSci Biochemistry student at the University of Birmingham, preparing for my professional placement year (2026).  
I’m passionate about bridging wet-lab biology with computational analysis to support data-driven decision-making in drug discovery.  

This repository is my informatics portfolio, bringing together small projects in Python and R that analyse biological or chemical data.  
Each folder contains a focused project demonstrating how I apply data cleaning, modelling, and visualisation techniques to real-world problems.  
The projects reflect my interests in drug discovery, assay analysis, and cheminformatics.

## Projects Overview  

### [Drug Response Analysis](./project-a-drug-response)  
Fits dose–response curves to pharmacology data to estimate IC₅₀/EC₅₀ values.  
- Uses non-linear regression models in R (tidyverse + nls).  
- Bootstrapped confidence intervals for parameters.  
- Generates publication-quality plots of curve fits and residuals.  
- Example data included with clear steps to run the analysis.

### [ELISA 4-Parameter Logistic Fit](./project-b-elisa-4pl)  
Implements a four-parameter logistic model (4-PL) for ELISA standard curves.  
- Calculates sample concentrations from absorbance values.  
- QC checks such as replicate CV%.  
- Generates calibration curves and diagnostic plots.  
- Written in R, with a lightweight Python version planned.

### [Cheminformatics Property Prediction](./project-c-cheminformatics)  
Uses RDKit and scikit-learn to explore molecular properties.  
- Computes basic descriptors (MolWt, LogP, HBD, HBA, TPSA).  
- Trains a simple regression model to predict solubility (ESOL data).  
- Evaluates model with MAE and RMSE metrics.  
- Produces error and parity plots to visualise predictions.

## Skills Demonstrated  

- Data cleaning, transformation & visualisation  
- Statistical modelling of biological data  
- Workflow automation (RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebooks)  
- Version control (Git, GitHub)  
- Communicating scientific results with clear visuals

## Future Goals  

I am actively expanding this portfolio with:  
- **New Python and R mini-projects** focused on drug discovery and informatics  
- **Exploration of interactive dashboards** for data visualisation (Plotly/Dash/Shiny)  
- **Integrating experimental data** from my wet-lab experience at BIFoR into reproducible analysis pipelines  

My long-term aspiration is to work at the intersection of **experimental biology and data science**, developing tools and analyses that drive innovation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.
