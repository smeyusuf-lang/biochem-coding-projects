# My STEM Projects & Coding Portfolio

Hi! I’m Sarah Yusuf — an MSci Biochemistry student at the University of Birmingham.  
This repo is where I’m collecting the coding and analytical projects I’m building alongside my degree.  
Each project is small, focused and reflects something I’ve been curious to try out.

---

## 🅰 Project A — [Name or Topic Here]
A short line about what this project does.  
For example: “An R project exploring enzyme kinetics data” or “Python script automating sample analysis.”

[Open Project A folder](project-a)

---

## 🅱 Project B — [Name or Topic Here]
A short line about what this project does.  
For example: “My first Python data cleaning pipeline for lab results” or “R visualisation of lipid metabolism pathways.”

[Open Project B folder](project-b)

---

## 🅲 Project C — Cheminformatics
My first hands-on computational chemistry project.  
I used a real solubility dataset (ESOL) with RDKit and scikit-learn to:
- Calculate basic molecular descriptors (MolWt, LogP, HBD, HBA)
- Plot trends (molecular weight vs solubility, LogP distribution)
- Train a simple linear model to predict solubility  
[Open Project C folder](project-c-cheminformatics)

## Why I’m doing this
I’m keen to combine my biochemistry background with coding and data analysis.  
This repo acts as a public portfolio of the skills I’m building for placement year applications and beyond.

## Next steps
- Add more Python and R mini-projects
- Expand cheminformatics project with additional descriptors or models
- Document my workflow more fully for each project
